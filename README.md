# ljextractor
Python script to extract posts and comments form a LiveJournal blog and save it to Wordpress importable format. 

This python script takes a live hournal and scrapes all the posts and comments from it and saves it out into a Wordpress importabl XML file. 

Options Full blog or Single post

It saves out by year and month with a max of 50 posts per XML file. 

There is also a CSV file created for any failed extractred posts and a log file teling you what it did. 

Comments are also extracted out and put into an importable format into wordpress. 

This is very much in BETA as I am still testing it and working out the kinks.
